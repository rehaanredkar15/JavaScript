<!-- /*jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities
Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.*/ -->

    jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event
    handling,
    CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[4] As of May 2019,
    jQuery
    is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed
    JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
    jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle
    events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of
    the
    JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced
    effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of
    powerful
    dynamic web pages and Web applications.
